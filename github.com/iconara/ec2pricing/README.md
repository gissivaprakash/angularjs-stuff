# EC2 Instance Types & Pricing

Have you ever found yourself flipping between the  [EC2 Pricing page][1] and the [EC2 Instance Type][2] pages when deciding on which EC2 instance type to choose? The first page displays the prices, the second the instance properties like CPU and RAM. Wouldn't it be better if the information was available in one, easily parsed table?

You can find that table on [ec2pricing.iconara.info][3], and the code that generates the data for it in this repository.

Many thanks to [Garret Heaton / @powdahound][4] whose [ec2instances.info][5] inspired me -- think of this as an improvement, with prices for all regions and a script to keep it current.
